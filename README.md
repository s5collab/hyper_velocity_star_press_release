Caption: An artist’s impression of S5-HVS1’s ejection by Sagittarius A*, the black hole at the center of the Galaxy. The black hole and the captured binary partner to S5-HVS1 are seen far away in the left corner of the picture, while S5-HVS1 is in the foreground, speeding away from them.

The video shows the motion of two stars as they orbit each other, as they approach the black hole, and then -- when the black hole comes close enough -- the binary system is destroyed and one of the stars (red one) is captured by the black hole, while the blue one is ejected with high speed.
